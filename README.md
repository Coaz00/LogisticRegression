# LogisticRegression
The goal of this project is to classify data into 3 classes using logistic regression. Since classificator based on logistic regression can only discriminate between two classes "one vs all" approach was applied. In other words, three classificators were trained one for every class. Each classificator says if example is from certain class or from other. In the add, values of hypothesis were compared and example was classified into class which classficator had highest value. For training stochastic gradient descent was used with batch size of 16 and learning rate of 0.1. Accuracy on train set was about 97% and on test set about 94%.
